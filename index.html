                through digital channels such as search engines, websites, social media, email, and mobile apps. Using
                these online media channels, digital marketing is the method by which companies endorse goods, services,
                and brands. Consumers heavily rely on digital means to research products. For example, Think with Google
                marketing insights found that 48% of consumers start their inquiries on search engines, while 33% look
                to brand websites and 26% search within mobile applications.While modern day digital marketing is an
                enormous system of channels to which marketers simply must onboard their brands, advertising online is
                much more complex than the channels alone. In order to achieve the true potential of digital marketing,
                marketers have to dig deep into today’s vast and intricate cross-channel world to discover strategies
                that make an impact through engagement marketing.
